2 Raw API PPP example for all protocols
=======================================

As usual, raw API for lwIP means the lightweight API which *MUST* only be used
for NO_SYS=1 systems or called inside lwIP core thread for NO_SYS=0 systems.

3 PPPoS input path (raw API, IRQ safe API, TCPIP API)
=====================================================

Received data on serial port should be sent to lwIP using the pppos_input()
function or the pppos_input_sys() function.

If NO_SYS is 1 and if PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE is 0 (the default), pppos_input()
is not IRQ safe and then *MUST* only be called inside your main loop.

Whatever the NO_SYS value, if PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE is 1, pppos_input() is IRQ
safe and can be safely called from an interrupt context, using that is going
to reduce your need of buffer if pppos_input() is called byte after byte in
your rx serial interrupt.

if NO_SYS is 0, the thread safe way outside an interrupt context is to use
the pppos_input_tcpip() function to pass input data to the lwIP core thread
using the TCPIP API. This is thread safe in all cases but you should avoid
passing data byte after byte because it uses heavy locking (mailbox) and it
allocates pbuf, better fill them !

if NO_SYS is 0 and if PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE is 1, you may also use pppos_input()
from an RX thread, however pppos_input() is not thread safe by itself. You can
do that *BUT* you should NEVER call pppos_connect(), pppos_listen() and
ppp_free() if pppos_input() can still be running, doing this is NOT thread safe
at all. Using PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE from an RX thread is discouraged unless you
really know what you are doing, your move ;-)


/*
 * Fonction to call for received data
 *
 * ppp, PPP control block
 * buffer, input buffer
 * buffer_len, buffer length in bytes
 */
void pppos_input(ppp, buffer, buffer_len);

or

void pppos_input_tcpip(ppp, buffer, buffer_len);


4 Thread safe PPP API (PPPAPI)
==============================

There is a thread safe API for all corresponding ppp_* functions, you have to
enable LWIP_PPP_API in your lwipopts.h file, then see include/lwip/pppapi.h,
this is actually pretty obvious.



5 Upgrading from lwIP <= 1.4.x to lwIP >= 1.5.x
===============================================

PPP API was fully reworked between 1.4.x and 1.5.x releases. However porting
from previous lwIP version is pretty easy:

* Previous PPP API used an integer to identify PPP sessions, we are now
  using ppp_pcb* control block, therefore all functions changed from "int ppp"
  to "ppp_pcb *ppp"

* struct netif was moved outside the PPP structure, you have to provide a netif
  for PPP interface in pppoX_create() functions

* PPP session are not started automatically after you created them anymore,
  you have to call ppp_connect(), this way you can configure the session before
  starting it.

* Previous PPP API used CamelCase, we are now using snake_case.

* Previous PPP API mixed PPPoS and PPPoE calls, this isn't the case anymore,
  PPPoS functions are now prefixed pppos_ and PPPoE functions are now prefixed
  pppoe_, common functions are now prefixed ppp_.

* New PPPERR_ error codes added, check you have all of them in your status
  callback function

* Only the following include files should now be used in user application:
  #include "lwip/pppapi.h"
  #include "netif/ppp/pppos.h"
  #include "netif/ppp/pppoe.h"
  #include "netif/ppp/pppol2tp.h"

  Functions from ppp.h can be used, but you don't need to include this header
  file as it is already included by above header files.

* PPP_INPROC_OWNTHREAD was broken by design and was removed, you have to create
  your own serial rx thread

* PPP_INPROC_MULTITHREADED option was misnamed and confusing and was renamed
  PPP_INPROC_IRQ_SAFE, please read the "PPPoS input path" documentation above
  because you might have been fooled by that

* If you used tcpip_callback_with_block() on ppp_ functions you may wish to use
  the PPPAPI API instead.

* ppp_sighup and ppp_close functions were merged using an optional argument
  "nocarrier" on ppp_close.

* DNS servers are now only remotely asked if LWIP_DNS is set and we are now
  unconditionally registering them, which is probably the wanted behavior in
  almost all cases. If you need it conditional contact us and we will made it
  conditional.

* PPPoS now requires a serial output callback

* PPP_MAXIDLEFLAG is now in ms instead of jiffies
